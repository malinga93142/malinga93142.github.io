##  About Me

I'm an **M.Sc. Computer Science** student at **Central University**, deeply passionate about the fundamentals of computing. For me, **core computer science is not just my passion—it is everyday life**.

I believe in understanding systems from the ground up, diving deep into:
- Computer Architecture & Organization
- Operating Systems & System Programming
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Memory Hierarchy & Cache Design
- Compilers & Programming Languages
- Low-level Programming & Assembly

##  My Notes & Documentation

I maintain detailed technical notes and documentation on various computer science topics. These are written to solidify my understanding and help others learn core CS concepts.

##  Philosophy

> "The best way to understand something is to build it from scratch, 
> question every abstraction, and never stop asking 'why?'"

I approach computer science with curiosity and rigor, always seeking to understand not just *what* works, but *why* it works and *how* it works at the lowest levels.


##  Currently Learning

- Advanced Computer Architecture (Out-of-Order Execution, Speculative Execution)
- Operating System Internals (Linux Kernel)
- High-Performance Computing
- Hardware-Software Interface Design
